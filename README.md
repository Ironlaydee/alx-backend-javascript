Node.js is a server-side platform based on the JavaScript Engine in Google Chrome. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, and the most recent version is v0.10.36. This is a cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications that are open source. Node.js programs are written in JavaScript and run on the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also comes with a big library of JavaScript modules, which makes developing Node.js web applications much easier.
